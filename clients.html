                <h4 class="mt-0">How much will it cost?</h4>
                <p>You can not figure out the cost to build by watching a program on television or searching the
                    Internet.
                </p>
                <p>There are too many variables to consider that are not explained online or on a television program.
                    The
                    only
                    realistic way to obtain an actual cost to build your project on your land is by working with a
                    general
                    contractor.</p>
                <p>Searching the Internet for costing information is an act of futility.</p>
                <p>The cost to any construction activity is a product of the material & local labor expense.
                    Geographical
                    economics vary greatly from state to state, city to city as does the availability of tradesmen and
                    suppliers.</p>

                <p>Answer - As soon as you are ready!</p>
                <p>We can start quoting your project as soon as you have Finalized Construction Documents.</p>
                <h4 class="mt-0 mb-1">What is your schedule?</h4>
                <p>Answer - We can Start anytime of the year!</p>
                <p>Our schedule is fluid, We can start your project as soon as its ready to go. Before we can physically
                    get started we need to get your permits</p>

                <h4 class="mt-0">What is Net Zero?</h4>
                <p>Answer - Net Zero is the balance between energy consumption and energy production.</p>
                <p>There are many aspects to obtaining Net Zero. The more energy your structure uses, the more energy
                    you or your family use the more energy you need to produce to be at net zero.</p>
                <p>If you are looking to own a net zero structure we highly recommend working with one of our architects
                    that specialize in the practice of designing Net Zero.</p>
                <p>Net Zero is a basic concept, nearly all architects will all say they understand net zero theory, not
                    all architects can accomplish net zero status in practice.</p>
                <p>Your energy production is equal to your usage.</p>

                <h4 class="mt-0 mb-1">What is "Sustainable Design"?</h4>
                <p>Sustainable Design - (You've probably heard the term used, good chance it was in an unclear context)
                </p>
                <p>"A balanced approach your architect implements throughout the development of your plan".</p>
                <p>Basic Considerations of Sustainable Design:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Energy and Water Consumption</li>
                    <li>Repetitive Maintenance Costs</li>
                    <li>Impact on Environment</li>
                    <li>Development of High Performance Concepts</li>
                    <li>Consideration For Increases In Future Economic Valuation</li>
                </ul>
                <p>There are varying levels of sustainable design - Sustainable minded architects understand the
                    complexities involving this style of design have varying levels of cost and recognize with every
                    client
                    there are varying levels of achievement based on budget constraints.</p>
                <p>Compromise - is a way to increase your level of sustainable implementation; Scaling down the scope of
                    work is a reasonable option; Reducing the overall square feet of your project can lower the cost to
                    construct and increase your level of sustainable considerations.</p>

                <p>(Attempting to use these software programs for custom projects put an owner at financial risk)</p>
                <p>Construction Estimating tools (Costing Software) that provide pricing based on national mean are good
                    in theory but they are not accurate unless your building a cookie cutter home in a tract development.
                    You on our website which means your not building a tract home.</p>
                <p>Packaged estimating cost tables/software is not dynamic from day to day, week to week or month to
                    month, in our view actuarial tables lag behind real-time approximately eight to ten years. Over a thirty year
                    time span we have compared locally sourced costing with estimating programs. In every case the variance
                    between current day local costs and costing tables were drastically different.</p>
                <p>Area modifiers for specific geographical locations are also behind, they do not account for
                    individual site conditions and they are not up to date regarding transportation costs for tradesmen or material

                <h4 class="mt-0 mb-1" style="text-align: center;">There Is No Silver Bullet To Pricing A Custom Project</h4>
                <p>Project costing requires a general contractor, skilled knowledgeable tradesmen and experienced
                    suppliers.</p>
                <p>One quarter of a project proposal is sending plans to suppliers and tradesmen the remaining three
                    quarters of a proposal is where a seasoned general contractor makes all the difference.</p>
                <p>Knowledge of how to present project documents to tradesmen and suppliers. A solid understanding of trade specific questions to ask when presenting construction documents.
                    Industry knowledge to answer tradesmen and supplier questions. An encompassing knowledge of how contractors think, operate and how they run their businesses.
                    Practical Application Experience.</p> 
                <p>After submitting plans and trade specific estimate directives a general contractor's effort to
                    collect comprehensive quotes requires continued consistent communication. If left to tradesmen and suppliers your
                    plan will gradually drop in urgency, one of the jobs of a general contractor is to keep your
                    projects hierarchy at the top of the tradesman's schedule. The typical tradesman physically works on
                    projects, after an eight to ten hour day the last thing they are motivated to do is come home and work on a new plan
                    estimate. This is a primary reason why it takes so much time to compile a complete proposal.</p>
                <p>The general contractor reviews tradesman quotes checking for thoroughness and verifies directives
                    were followed as submitted. When quotes are not accurate, we send them back with a revised set of
                    directives and additional pressure heightening urgency to make corrections and resubmit without delay. When quotes
                    are returned for corrections and updates the time to complete our proposal can be extended.</p>
                <p>Interpreting estimates and quotes takes more than looking at the total. As our proposal is assembled,
                    we review each quote once again, rereading every line of every quote assuring we incorporate all
                    inclusions and exclusions.</p>
                <p>Formatting a proposal is not a plug in scenario, each proposal is crafted specifically to a project.
                    There are similarities with every job but every job has unique detail that needs to be included in a user
                    friendly structure. In a format that can be readily searched.</p>

                <p>"Green Building" a term commonly used to describe Sustainable Design"</p>
                <p>Adding Solar - Does Not Make a Project Green.</p>
                <p>Geothermal Heating & Cooling - Does Not Make Your Project Green.</p>
                <p> Adding these individual components does make your project "GREENER" than it was or could have been
                    but it only scratches the surface in the "Green Building" realm.</p>
                <p>"Sustainable Designed Projects are Green Building Projects".</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your architect can certify the your level of green without engaging in established "LEEDS"
                        program.</li>
                    <p> General Public "LEEDS" Understanding</p>
                    <li> Most people have heard the acronym "LEEDS" thanks to their marketing efforts, but most people
                        have no true understanding of the LEEDS program or levels of the program. The average conception
                        is that by achieving a LEEDS certification somehow means they are doing their part to save the plant. We
                        don't argue this but we know you can "do your part" without "LEEDS as long as you have the right
                        architect.</li>
                    <li>Eventually most people will recognize while working with their architect there is an economic
                        threshold limiting the level of green, if your on a tight budget you should understand "LEEDS" adds to the
                        budget strain.</li>
                    <li> The LEEDS program certification is not overly important to us as a general contractor, what is
                        important to us is Sustainable Design.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We "Build Green"/"Sustainable" with or without LEEDS.</p>
                <p> Resale Value & LEEDS</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Its is not abundantly clear how much more people are willing to pay for a LEEDS certified
                        product -vs- a product that is green built without LEEDS certification. The majority of practicing realtors
                        have no about LEEDS, as a result they don't push certified homes over non certified.</li>
                    <li>Regardless of your interest in achieving certifications we are always interested in 'Building
                        Green" - If your budget does not allow you to follow an established program such as LEEDS, we are
                        confident our architects can design your structure as green as your budget allows. If your budget allows for
                        and your focused on achieving a LEEDS certification we are happy to assist.</li>
                    <li>Some green is good, more green is better. Determining your level of green is completely up to
                        you, your 
                        architect and your budget.</li>
                </ul>
